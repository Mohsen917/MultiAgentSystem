A sophisticated multi-agent system that combines the power of DeepSeek and Gemini AI models to provide comprehensive, up-to-date information in response to user queries.

## 🌟 Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Utilizes three specialized agents working together:

  - **Researcher**: Gathers the latest information using DuckDuckGo search
  - **Analyst**: Evaluates and extracts key insights from research findings
  - **Writer**: Creates well-structured, comprehensive responses

- **Dual AI Model Integration**: Leverages both DeepSeek and Gemini models for enhanced capabilities

- **Up-to-Date Information**: Specifically designed to prioritize recent information and developments

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean Streamlit interface for easy interaction

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- LangChain
- LangGraph
- DeepSeek API key
- Gemini API key

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohsen917/MultiAgentSystem.git

   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 💻 Usage

1. Launch the application using the command above
2. Enter your DeepSeek and Gemini API keys in the sidebar
3. Type your query in the chat input
4. Receive a comprehensive response generated by the multi-agent system

## 🔧 How It Works

The system follows a sequential workflow:

1. **User Input**: The user submits a query through the Streamlit interface
2. **Research Phase**: The Researcher agent (DeepSeek) searches for the latest information
3. **Analysis Phase**: The Analyst agent (Gemini) processes and extracts insights
4. **Content Creation**: The Writer agent (DeepSeek) crafts the final response
5. **Output**: The comprehensive answer is presented to the user

## 📊 Architecture

```
User Query → Researcher Agent → Analyst Agent → Writer Agent → Final Response
```
